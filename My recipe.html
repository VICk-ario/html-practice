        <i>Preparation</i><br>
             <u>Step 1</u><br>
                   In a large bowl combine all ingredients, i.e. tomato sauce, 1 onion and tomato paste.<br>
             <u>Step 2</u><br>
                    Shape meatballs into round balls then place them on a lightly oiled pan and fry until light brown.<br>
                    Or you can bake them for 10-12 minutes or until browned.<br>
             <u>Step 3</u><br>
                    To make the sauce, sauté the remaining onion in a pan over medium heat.<br>
                    Add in your desired seasoning before stirring in the tomato paste, a little water and garlic powder.<br>
             <u>Step 4</u><br>
                    Simmer the sauce then add both tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste.<br>
                    While stirring, ensure the tomatoes are fully cooked before adding the fried meatballs in the mixture.<br>
             <u>Step 5</u><br>
                    Serve over pasta or rice and enjoy with friends and family. <br>
